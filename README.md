# STM32Bootloader

Arduino-style bootloader for an STM32 L0x3 mcu using bare metal programming.

I made this code because similar bootloader solutions are difficult to come by, use, port or simply understand.

Also they are mostly done with focus on the BluePill (STM32F103) which is different than the L053 I am using.

I want to provide a step-by-step project evolution later to this bootloader project, sharing my thinking so whoever might come across this code (me included in 10 years of time) would have no trouble to replicate (and understand!) the results.

Currently only the code is added without explanation. Will get there shortly.
